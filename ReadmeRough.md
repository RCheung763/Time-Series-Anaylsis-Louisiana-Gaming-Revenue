## Introduction
The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare forecasting methods to achieve the highest accuracy forecast of the monthly revenue of Harrah’s casino located in New Orleans, Louisiana. The models considered are ARIMA, ETS, and Meta’s Prophet. We will evaluate the model performance in forecasting revenue one month, 6 months, and 1 year out. 

This dataset posed an interesting problem as it contains two back-to-back outliers. One was a result of COVID lockdown in the spring of 2020 and the second was a result of Hurricane Ida the following year.

## Explorator Analysis 

Figure 1 is our dataset plotted across time. From visual inspection we can see a general downward trend, and we can see the effects of the pandemic lockdowns begining March of 2020 and the gradual return of revenue as the state slowly reopened. We can also see the dip in revenues because of hurricane Ida in August the following year.
